# Bank Loans Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze and visualize data from a bank loans dataset to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes various details about loan applicants such as employment length, loan grade, home ownership, loan status, and financial metrics like annual income and debt-to-income ratio. Our goal is to identify patterns and trends in loan approval and repayment, understand factors contributing to good vs. bad loans, and develop dashboards for quick and intuitive data interpretation.

## Tech Stack

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: For summarizing data and creating dynamic dashboards.
- **Conditional Formatting**: For highlighting key metrics and trends in the dashboards.

## Skills Gained

- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Dashboard Creation
- Data Analysis
- Visualization

## Workflow Steps

1. **Data Import**: Loaded the dataset into Excel and reviewed its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, standardized date formats, and corrected data types for accurate analysis.
3. **Transformation**: Used Power Query to shape the data, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating relevant columns.
4. **Analysis**:
   - *Loan Status Analysis*: Examined the distribution of good vs. bad loans across different grades, purposes, and states.
   - *Financial Metrics Analysis*: Analyzed the impact of annual income, DTI ratio, and loan amount on loan status.
5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - *Summary Dashboard*: Presented key metrics such as total loans issued, average interest rates, and overall loan performance.
   - *Overview Dashboard*: Provided detailed breakdowns by state, employment length, and other loan attributes.
6. **Validation**: Ensured data accuracy by cross-verifying results with raw data and recalculating key metrics.
7. **Conclusions**: Summarized findings related to loan grade impact,  employment length, and state-wise variations.
